# BeSafe - be you be safe

## Description 📜

Application that allows reporting and registering cases of violence against the LGTBI community to obtain a preview of the city map in real time that delimits the areas where these types of acts occur or have occurred and which areas are safe, generating statistical data that indicate which groups within the community are the most affected and determine which places in Cali are the ones that present the most cases of violence, in which neighborhoods and under what circumstances they occurred, on what days, at what time, who was the aggressor, whether it was reported or not.

Record levels of violence and generate alarms (depending on the type and degree of violence) directed at support groups or human rights defenders.
